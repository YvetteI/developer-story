<p> Yvette I
This my develop story
I first got introduced to computers when I came to America.
The first time I was introduced to coding was In my 5th grade technology class, where we would go to this website called coding.com and complete coding games. 
I havenâ€™t really been into coding since 5th grade but I'm really grateful that I have this class so I can get back into it.
I joined the refcode class because I wanted to expand my skills in coding.
